### Kleitman-Rothschild Sets
My published work deals with causal set theory, a proposal for the
quantization of space-time. It can be shown that you can reconstruct important
features of a space-time manifold from the causal connections of randomly
distributed points on it. However almost all random distributions of causal
links, instead of looking like a manifold, form some small number of moments
of time (typically three, in an arrangement known as a Kleitman-Rothschild
order).

This distribution of causal sets presents a problem, as the natural way to
work with quantum gravity on these sets is a path integral across all possible
arrangements. In
[Path Integral Suppression of Badly Behaved Causal Sets](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/acc50c), 
my collaborators and I show that Kleitman-Rothschild sets, 
while common, have a negligible impact on the path integral, as the weight given by each 
due to its action drops as {{< katex >}} \\(2^{-n^2}\\). A followup work, 
[The Einstein–Hilbert action for entropically dominant causal sets](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/ad506e), extends this result to other such layered sets.

The main body of the work, and my primary contribution to it, consists of
combinatorics. The formula used for the action involves counting the number of
points in 2 layers that are connected through exactly some small number of
intermediate points. As it is highly unlikely that there are no other
intermediate points, the number of such arrangements in any given set falls
extremely quickly with the set's size.
